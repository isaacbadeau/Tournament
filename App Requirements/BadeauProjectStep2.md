There are many issues to address when creating an application to track a tournament. How will matches be set and how will I deal with an odd number of players? Will there be prizes and how will they be implemented? How will I inform both players and people following the results and upcoming matches? Will I allow teams as well as solo play? How will the data be stored?  What will the interface be?

Initial matches will be assigned randomly.  I will not be using a seeding system as it's very difficult to establish seed for players from all over the place.  Obviously there are some big names out there, but they will have to work their way up just like everyone else.  If there is an odd number of players there will be bi's generated randomly.

There will be an entry fee with prizes going to 1st, 2nd and 3rd places.  I have not yet determined the dispursement. I would LIKE to do it this way, but I think it may be too complicated to implement with credit card info and such. If it can be utilized in say, an office, the monetary transactions can be done in house.

Players and people following along will be able to see results and upcoming events directly from the site.  I am going to work on an email system to inform players of results and upcoming matches.

The data will be stored in a SQL DB.  The data will be primarily, player data and match results.

Initially I will be setting this up either as a Windows Forms or UWP userface with the final product being a website.

As you can see I have a lot of issues to deal with.  I am going to start small and hope I can pull everything together by the end of the program.
