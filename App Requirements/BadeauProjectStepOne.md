I have a two main ideas of what I would like to do. I am very interested in physics so I would like to do something related 
to that. I've also been involved with MUD RPGs for about 24 years so I was thinking of making a small text based game.

I'm not entirely sure what I would do with physics that would encompass all the coding skills we will learn. I was thinking
of a program that did multiple calculations.  Such as how fast you would fall on every planet in the solar system, as well as
terminal velocities and potential/kinetic energies. Some other gravity related calculations.  However I feel like this may not be in
depth enough to fully utilize things like interfaces and databases. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

As for the text based game.  This may be too large of a task.  I could certainly utilize all of the skills we will learn
but I may be bitting off more than I can chew.  I have no idea how to develop a combat engine. I have no idea how to make
a mapping system without an insane amount of if statements. I would have to make an interface for mobs, then an interface
for NPCs...It's a bit overwhelming.  Again, any thoughts would be appreciated.
